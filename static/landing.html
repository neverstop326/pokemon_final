        <h3>Let me tell you about the Pokemon movie!</h3>
        <p>The PokÃ©mon of Ash Ketchum, Misty, 
            and Brock are sent to spend a day at a theme park built for PokÃ©mon. 
            Pikachu, Togepi, Bulbasaur, 
            and Squirtle cross paths with a group of bullies consisting of a Raichu, Cubone, Marill, 
            and a Snubbull. 
            The two groups compete against each other in sports, 
            but it leads to Ash's Charizard getting its head stuck in a pipe. 
            Pikachu, his friends, and the bullies work together 
            and successfully free Charizard and rebuild the park, 
            spending the rest of the day playing before parting ways when their trainers return.</p>
